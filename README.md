# hello-world
1st attempt. Lets see how it goes.
The guide I am following to complete this readme mentioned how hubot has had tacos on the moon. I really enjoy burritos and I'm wondering if the burritos on the moon are also superior or if it only applies to moon tacos.

While I dont know anything about coding or web development today (3/20/17) I hope that I'll be able to look back on this project in the future with a smile at this humble beginning.
